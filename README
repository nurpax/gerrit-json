Haskell code to parse Gerrit's JSON responses from the query command

BSD license.

Requires the text.JSON package for JSON parsing.  I think this is
included in the Haskell platform.

Code provided as-is.  It's not written to be very generic and probably
not good at handling errors.

To run it:

runhaskell Test.hs <gerrit server name>
